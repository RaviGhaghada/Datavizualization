HOW GRAPH.PY WORKS:

Plotting a bar graph: 

1.  Acquire the details from a sheet
2.  Calculate the total incidents recorded for each different category of crime with a format like ("Theft": 42, "Assault": 53)
3.  Store the keys ("Theft", "Assault"...) in a tuple so that it can be used to label the x-axis
4.  Generate a list marking the positions of each label on the x-axis
5.  Set width of the bar
6.  Assign data to the plot using the positions of labels, the value of each labels, and the orientation of the labels on the x-axis.
7.  By trial and error, extend the bar graph so that the labels don't fall out of the image.
8.  Manipulate the bar plot's overall size according to needs
9.  Save the graph
10. Close the figure
